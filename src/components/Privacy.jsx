        Last Updated: December 31, 2021 Ozone Networks, Inc. d/b/a OpenSea
        (“OpenSea,” “we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your
        privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our
        practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect,
        use, and share in connection with the OpenSea website, mobile app, and
        other software provided on or in connection with our services, as
        described in our Terms of Service (collectively, the “Service”). “NFT”
        in this Privacy Policy means a non-fungible token or similar digital
        item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain),
        which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with
        certain content or data. Types of Data We Collect. “Personal Data” means
        data that allows someone to identify you individually, including, for
        example, your name, email address, as well as any other non-public
        information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the
        foregoing. “Anonymous Data” means data, including aggregated and
        de-identified data, that is not associated with or linked to your
        Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the
        identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and
        Anonymous Data as described below. Information You Provide Us. When you
        use our Service, update your account profile, or contact us, we may
        collect Personal Data from you, such as email address, first and last
        name, user name, and other information you provide. We also collect your
        blockchain address, which may become associated with Personal Data when
        you use our Service. Our Service lets you store preferences like how
        your content is displayed, notification settings, and favorites. We may
        associate these choices with your ID, browser, or mobile device. If you
        provide us with feedback or contact us, we will collect your name and
        contact information, as well as any other content included in the
        message. We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our
        Service where you voluntarily provide it or where we state that Personal
        Data is being collected. Information Collected via Technology. As you
        navigate through and interact with our Service, we may use automatic
        data collection technologies to collect certain information about your
        equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including: Information
        Collected by Our Servers. To provide our Service and make it more useful
        to you, we (or a third party service provider) collect information from
        you, including, but not limited to, your browser type, operating system,
        Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, mobile device ID, blockchain address,
        wallet type, and date/time stamps. Log Files. As is true of most
        websites and applications, we gather certain information automatically
        and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses,
        browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages,
        operating system, date/time stamps, and clickstream data. We use this
        information to analyze trends, administer the Service, track users’
        movements around the Service, and better tailor our Services to our
        users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so
        that when you visit the Service, it will recognize you and the
        information can be used to personalize your experience. Cookies. Like
        many online services, we use cookies to collect information. We may use
        both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and
        persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them)
        to analyze how users interact with our Service, make improvements to our
        product quality, and provide users with a more personalized experience.
        Pixel Tag. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear
        Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags allow us to analyze how
        users find our Service, make the Service more useful to you, and tailor
        your experience with us to meet your particular interests and needs. How
        We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. Our systems do not currently
        recognize “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that might enable
        Users to opt out of tracking on our site. Analytics Services. In
        addition to the tracking technologies we place like Cookies and Pixel
        Tags, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when
        you visit our Service. This includes third-party analytics services
        (“Analytics Services”) that we engage to help analyze how users use the
        Service. The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies
        about your use of our Service (the “Analytics Information”) is
        transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use
        Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity, which we may
        receive on an individual or aggregate basis. We use the information we
        get from Analytics Services to improve our Service. The Analytics
        Services may also transfer information to third parties where required
        to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics
        Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Services’ ability to use and
        share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Services’
        terms of use and privacy policy. By using our Service, you consent to
        the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and
        for the purposes set out above. Information Collected from Third-Party
        Companies. We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from
        companies that offer their products and/or services for use in
        conjunction with our Service or whose products and/or services may be
        linked from our Service. For example, third-party wallet providers
        provide us with your blockchain address and certain other information
        you choose to share with those wallets providers. We may add this to the
        data we have already collected from or about you through our Service.
        Public Information Observed from Blockchains. We collect data from
        activity that is publicly visible and/or accessible on blockchains. This
        may include blockchain addresses and information regarding purchases,
        sales, or transfers of NFTs, which may then be associated with other
        data you have provided to us. Use of Your Personal Data. We process your
        Personal Data to run our business, provide the Service, personalize your
        experience on the Service, and improve the Service. Specifically, we use

        account; identify you as a user in our system; provide you with our
        Service, including, but not limited to, helping you view, explore, and
        create NFTs using our tools and, at your own discretion, connect
        directly with others to purchase, sell, or transfer NFTs on public
        blockchains; improve the administration of our Service and quality of
        experience when you interact with our Service, including, but not

        the Service; provide customer support and respond to your requests and
        inquiries; investigate and address conduct that may violate our Terms of

        username next to the NFTs currently or previously accessible in your
        third-party wallet, and next to NFTs on which you have interacted; send
        you a welcome email to verify ownership of the email address provided
        when your account was created; send you administrative notifications,
        such as security, support, and maintenance advisories; send you
        notifications related to actions on the Service, including notifications
        of offers on your NFTs; send you newsletters, promotional materials, and
        other notices related to our Services or third parties' goods and
        services; respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities
        or other requests; comply with applicable laws, cooperate with
        investigations by law enforcement or other authorities of suspected
        violations of law, and/or to pursue or defend against legal threats
        and/or claims; and act in any other way we may describe when you provide
        the Personal Data. We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal
        Data. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns
        so that we may improve our Services and enhance Service navigation. We
        reserve the right to use Anonymous Data for any purpose and to disclose
        Anonymous Data to third parties without restriction. Disclosure of Your

        proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all
        or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency,
        bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be transferred as a
        business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or
        assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and
        will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as
        described in this Privacy Policy. Legal Rights. Regardless of any
        choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below),
        OpenSea may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that
        such disclosure is necessary: (a) in connection with any legal
        investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to
        subpoenas, warrants, or other legal process served on OpenSea; (c) to
        protect or defend the rights or property of OpenSea or users of the

        you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our
        Service and go to another site, and another entity may collect Personal
        Data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be
        responsible for these third-party websites or their content. Please be
        aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these
